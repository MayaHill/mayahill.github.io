        <div class="text-border light-text">
            <p>Hi, I'm Maya, a 19-year-old aspiring gameplay programmer from Montpellier, France!
                Currently studying as a 3rd year student at <a href="https://www.epitech.eu/" target="_blank">EPITECH</a> and pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science, I've chosen to specialise myself in game programming.
                <br><br>In those 3 years, I've been able to experience many events such as hackathons, game jams, a Game Camp, as well as a 5 month internship at <a href="https://www.thegamebakers.com/" target="_blank">TheGameBakers</a>!
                <br>I've also had the opportunity to participate in and then run the school's GDC (Game Dev Club) and become an Educational Assistant to share my skills and experience with younger students.
                <br><br>My main programming languages are C, C++ and C# and I'm most comfortable with Unity and Godot, but I'm always up for a new challenge.
                <br><br>I hope to continue to improve myself, learn new skills and meet new people along the way!
            </p>
